===============

Integration of the code in bests into madness may require some changes to the 
namespace, and on bgp it may be necessary to add another couple lines so that 
a .o compiled with xlc can be used by gcc.

Running
-------

For available options run:

    $ python3 main.py -h


Testing
-------

Not that there are any real tests implemented, but:

To run tests, execute the following command:

    $ python3 -m unittest


Profiling
---------

    $ python3 -m cProfile main.py


TODO
----

*   Remove dumb lambda functions
*   Is an acceptable reveresed-b fma available on bgq?
