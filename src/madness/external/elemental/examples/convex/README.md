### `examples/convex`

This folder contains a few examples of using Elemental for tasks related to
convex optimization:

-  `LogDetDivergence.cpp`: Compute a divergence based upon the log of the 
   determinant of an HPD matrix
-  `RPCA.cpp`: A simple Robust Principal Component Analysis example which allows
   for choosing between several different SVT algorithms
